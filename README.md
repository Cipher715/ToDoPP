# Overview

This is a To-Do management application with C++.

Using libraries such as fstream and vector, this program provides you a to-do management system.
You can create tasks, mark the tasks as completed, delete tasks, and list tasks.
This app will automatically create "tasks.txt" on the directory, and save all the tasks.

With having "todo_pp.cpp" on your machine, run "g++ todo_pp.cpp -o todo_pp", and "./todo_pp".
